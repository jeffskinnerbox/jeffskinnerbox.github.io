# Power Supplies
The output of a power supply can operate in either constant voltage (CV) or constant current (CC) mode depending on
the voltage setting, current limit setting, and load resistance.

* If the load current is low and the current drawn is LESS than the current
setting, the power supply will operate in CV mode. The voltage is regulated,
keeping the value constant, with the current being determined by the load.
* If the load current is high and the load is trying to draw MORE current than
the current setting, the power supply will limit the current at the current setting
value and operate in CC mode. The current is regulated with the voltage being
determined by the load.

Most power supplies are designed in such a way that it is optimized for CV operation.
