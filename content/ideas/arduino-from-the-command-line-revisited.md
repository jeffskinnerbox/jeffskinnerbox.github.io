# Arduino On The Command Line
For someone like myself, who is at home with Linux as my OS and Vim as my editor,
using the [Arduino IDE][03] for Arduino coding is a step back into the stone age.
If you are used to doing these things yourself and controlling the organization of your code
then the Arduino IDE does some really arbitrary and annoying things.
For example, try sharing a common file between your sketch and modules (that is, Arduino libraries)
which you may or not use depending on what sketch you are compiling.
The Arduino will compile everything in the directory with the included file.
You have no say in what gets compiled and in what context.

I'm not the first to lament about the this topic, but more importantly,
some people have stepped forward and done something about it!
The folks at Arduino have given us [Installing Arduino on Linux][01], which gives us
a Arduino IDE, but more importantly, the foundation of this package are executables
and libraries that can be called executed outside of the IDE.
Others like [Martin Oldfield and Sudar Muthu][02] have given us the Linux package `arduino-mk`
which allows you to use the core tools that form the foundation for the Arduino IDE.
Those foundational tools are within the package `arduino-core`.
The actual Arduino IDE is in the package `arduino`.
But these Makefile tools don't easily support the ESP8266/ESP32 boards,
which prompted the creation of [Esp8266-Arduino-Makefile][17]
to get support for the ESP architecture but abandoned the Arduino boards.

I wanted to avoid all this confusion and get on a path that will remain compatible
with the future evolution of the Arduino IDE.
I discovered that [Arduino has released a command line interface (CLI)][13],
called `arduino-cli`,
that performs most of the features present in the Arduino IDE.
The Arduino CLI aims to replace the majority of features the Arduino IDE has without the graphical UI.
The CLI will allow you to Install new libraries, create new projects,
and compile projects directly from the command line.
And it appears the goal of the Arduino CLI in any kind of script for the command line.
So in principle, it should work in a standard Makefile too.

>**NOTE:** As of January 2, 2012 `arduino-cli` is **not** considered stable
>and is being offered as a alpha version.
>See the [`arduino-cli` github site][14] for more information.
>At this time, the "offical" recommendation for a Arduino command line tool is
>[`arduino`][16] and the not so "offical" [PlatformIO][22].

One of the things that comes free with the Arduino IDE is a serial monitor.
Of course, this is an indispensable tool for both testing and debugging,
and I don't want to loss this capability.
We haven't abandoned this capability since there are Linux alternatives.
The post [Arduino and Linux TTY][04] provides a series of solutions.
(What is listed below isn't always functional for every need, so consult the posting for more ideas.)

Some of your best monitoring options are:

* Assuming the Arduino's USB is plugged into `/dev/ACM0` and the port speed is set to `57600`,
`cu -l /dev/ttyACM0 -s 57600` will get you simple connect.
For more commands, consult the [`cu` manual page][07].
* You can use [`screen`][08] to provide a more interactive serial monitor session with an Arduino.
The command `screen /dev/ttyACM0 57600` is similar to the above.
See [Linux Screen Tutorial and How To][05]
[Screen User's Manual][06] for more information about the power of `screen`.

What follows is how I installed the [Arduino IDE][03], the [Arduino CLI][14]
and used it with [GNU Make (aka Makefile)][15].
Doing this, I can create an all command line (or nearly all)
software development experance while still leveraging the popularity of the Arduino IDE platform.

-----

## Installing the Arduino IDE
[Arduino][11] is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects.
Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller)
and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer,
used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.
There is [Linux build of the Arduino IDE][09],
as well as [alternatives to the standard Arduino IDE][10].

### Step 1: Installing Arduino IDE - DONE
You could install the Arduino IDE via the Ubuntu Software Center and search for Arduino.
Alternatively, you can install via the command line by running the following:

```bash
# install arduino from software repositories (NOT RECOMMENDED)
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install arduino arduino-core
```

The above installs a package from the Ubuntu software repositories,
which likely to be an older Arduino IDE version.
The newest version of the Arduino can be downloaded from the [Arduino download page][12].
(**NOTE:** Using this method Arduino software won't automatically be updated,
so you should check Arduino website every few months and download
a new version if one is available.)

```bash
# download the software - arduino-nightly-linux64.tar.xz
# from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
#                    or
# ARDUINO 1.8.8 official release at
# https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Donate

# uncompress the tarball
cd ~/Downloads
tar -xvf arduino-1.8.8-linux64.tar.xz

# move the result folder to /opt directory for global use
mv arduino-1.8.8 arduino
mv ~/Downloads/arduino ~/src

# run the script to install both desktop shortcut and launcher icon
cd ~/src/arduino
./install.sh
ln -s ~/src/arduino/arduino ~/bin/arduino

# brltty (braille device) which will conflict with the Arduino
sudo apt-get remove brltty
```

The `./install.sh` step will also create the directory `$HOME/.arduino15`.
This will play an important role in preferences, boards,
and libraries within the Arduino environment.

### Step 2: Quick Test - DONE
Lets do a quick check on the install:

```bash
# print version and build information for the arduino ide and exit
$ arduino --version
Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS:
Sketchbook folder disappeared: The sketchbook folder no longer exists.
Arduino will switch to the default sketchbook
location, and create a new sketchbook folder if
necessary. Arduino will then stop talking about
himself in the third person.
Loading configuration...
Initializing packages...
Preparing boards...
Arduino: 1.8.8
```

This will also create the directory `$HOME/Arduino` to hold your sketchbook.
We'll be removing this in a later step.

When the Arduino Software IDE is properly installed you can execute
the IDE via the command `arduino &>/dev/null &` or the desktop icon.

>**NOTE:** It might happen that when you upload a sketch
>(after you have selected your board and serial port),
>you get an error Error opening serial port.
>If you get this error, you need to [set serial port permission][23].

### Step 3: Setup Your Arduino IDE Preferences - DONE
Normally, running the `arduino` command starts the IDE,
optionally loading any `.ino` files specified on the commandline.
Also, it normally puts all your Arduino sketches and project libraries within
a common directory defaulting to `$HOME/Arduino`.
Lets change this location:

1. Start the Arduino IDE, select the menu button **File** > **Preferences**
2. Change the "Sketchbook location" to `$HOME/src/arduino/sketchbooks`
(make sure you do this via the **Browse** button) and save it.
3. Restart the Arduino and the directory will be prepared automatically for you.

>**NOTE:** Some preferences, but not all,
>can be controlled from the Preferences dialog within the Arduino environment (see [here][19]).
>More preferences can be edited directly in the file `$HOME/.arduino15/preferences.txt`
>but only edit when the Arduino IDE is **not** running.

### Step 4: Remove Old Sketch Directory - DONE
The new `sketchbook` directory create above contains a subdirectory `libraries`
(created the next time you start the Arduino IDE).
`$HOME/src/arduino/sketchbooks/libraries` is where all your libraries will go
(both downloads and personal ones you create).
Improperly installing libraries can be a major source of confusion within the Arduino world.
Check out Adafruit's "[All About Arduino Libraries][18]" for their proper care and feeding.

Now that your sketches and libraries have a new location,
make sure to remove the default location created during the Arduino IDE install:

```bash
# remove the old sketchbook location
rm -r -f Arduino
```

### Step 5: Move Back Saved Sketches - DONE
If you saved any sketch from a previous install, you can simply copy them into the
`$HOME/src/arduino/sketchbooks` directory.
For example:

```bash
# copy your old sketches into you new sketchbook
cp -r ~/tmp/sketchbooks ~/src/arduino
```

### Step 6: Load Needed Boards - DONE
The ESP8266 addon for the Arduino IDE
is provided by the ESP8266 community.
([lead by Ivan Grokhotkov of Espressif][36]).
Check out the [ESP8266 Arduino GitHub repository][37] for more information.
To see more detailed instructions on installing  ESP8266 support on your Arduino IDE,
see [SparkFun's ESP8266 Thing Hookup Guide][38].
[ESP8266 Arduino libraries documentation][39] can be found online.

Here are the abbreviated installation steps:

1. Start the Arduino Software IDE via the command `arduino &>/dev/null &`.
2. Open the preferences window from the Arduino IDE.
Go to **File** > **Preferences**
3. Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into
the **Additional Board Manager URLs** field as shown in the figure below. Then, click the **OK** button.
(**NOTE:** If you already have a URL in there, and want to keep it,
you can separate multiple URLs by placing a comma between them.)
4. Navigate to the Board Manager by going to **Tools** > **Board** menu > **Boards Manager**.
There should be a couple new entries in addition to the standard Arduino boards.
Look for ESP8266. Click on that entry, then select **Install** for version 2.4.2.
5. While your at it, you should repeat steps 2,3 & 4 for the ESP32 (see [arduino-esp32 GitHub][40]).
These libraries are located at https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
and do the install fo version 1.0.0.
6. Restart the Arduino IDE

If you need additional boards to be supported,
this can be done via repeating the process above.

>**NOTE: The Arduino command line tool, `arduino-cli`, appears to be able to install boards
>(via `arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32@1.0.0` and `arduino-cli core install esp8266:esp8266@2.4.2`)
>but using the Arduino IDE may be the simplest way for now.

### Step X: Changing IDE Default Window Size
I find the default window side of the Arduino IDE a big announce.
Within the `~/.arduino15/prefrences.txt` file,
update the preferences to the following:

```
editor.window.height.min=800
editor.window.width.min=1000
```

### Step X: Install SPIFFS Tools
There are two ways to store data on ESP8266:

* The first is using internal EEPROM which is of 512 Bytes
but you can write data 1 millions of times (no file system).
* The second is use of SPI Flash (64kBytes to 3Mbyte).
In this flash memory ESP stores the program.
Along with program you can store your files on it.
Limitation of this memory is it has only 10000 (ten thousand) write cycles.

Even though file system is stored on the same flash chip as the program,
programming new sketch will not modify file system contents.
This allows to use file system to store sketch data, configuration files,
or content for things like Web server.
File system size depends on the flash chip size.
Depending on the board, you have the following [options for flash size][33]:

|      BOARD      | FLASH CHIP SIZE, BYTES | FILE SYSTEM SIZE, BYTES |
|:---------------:|:----------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| Generic module  |          512k          |          64k            |
| Generic module  |          1M            |  64k, 128k, 256k, 512k  |
| Generic module  |          2M            |           1M            |
| Generic module  |          4M            |           3M            |
| Adafruit HUZZAH |          4M            |         1M, 3M          |
| NodeMCU 0.9     |          4M            |         1M, 3M          |
| NodeMCU 1.0     |          4M            |         1M, 3M          |

So the first thing you need to know the size of the flash memory
attached to esp8266 on your module.
Common sizes are 512 kB (4Mbit), 1 MB (8Mbit) and 4 MB.
You can use the [esptool][32] can determine it.

You can choose the size of the SPIFFS in your [flash 'layout'][33]
by selecting the option in the Arduino's IDE Tools menu
or via the esptool. Pick one according to for you flash size
and size of the files you want to put into SPIFFS.

>**NOTE:** If you have 1 MB flash on your module and you want to use OTA upload,
>set flash space for twice a space taken by the sketch.

### Step X: Uninstall Arduino IDE
The Arduino IDE package comes with an uninstall script but it doesn't do a complete removal
of all the configuration files and modifications made above.
The procedure below should do the trick.

Copy any of your sketch and personal libraries you may wish to keep.
Don't worry about public libraries since they can be reinstalled for sources.

```bash
# copy your sketches but remove libraries since you will re-install them
cp -r ~/src/arduino/sketchbooks ~/tmp
rm -r -f ~/tmp/sketchbooks/libraries

# move to the location of the arduino ide and run the uninstall script
cd ~/src/arduino
./uninstall.sh

# remove your symbolic link to the arduino ide executable
rm ~/bin/arduino

# remove the entire arduino ide directory
rm -r -f ~/src/arduino

# remove the arduino ide confguration files
rm -r -f ~/Arduino ~/.ardunio15
```

## Installing the Arduino Commond Line Interface - `arduino-cli`
[Arduino has released a command line interface (CLI)][13], called `arduino-cli`,
that performs most of the features present in the Arduino IDE.
The CLI will allow you to Install new libraries, create new projects,
and compile projects directly from the command line.
The goal of the Arduino CLI is to be including it in Makefile
or in any kind of script for the command line.
The Arduino CLI aims to replace the majority of features
the Arduino IDE has without the graphical UI.

There isn't a great deal of documentation on `arduino-cli`
but I found these sites useful:

* [Arduino now has a command line interface (CLI)](https://hub.packtpub.com/arduino-now-has-a-command-line-interface-cli/)
* [Tutorial on the Arduino Command Line Interface (CLI)][21]
* [Arduino Command Line Interface](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli)
* [Arduino CLI Command Line Interface Getting Started (Mac and Windows)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LPSjucQoso)
* [Arduino Gets Command Line Interface Tools That Let You Skip the IDE](https://hackaday.com/2018/08/26/arduino-gets-command-line-interface-tools-that-let-you-skip-the-ide/)

>**NOTE:** As of January 2, 2012 `arduino-cli` is **not** considered stable
>and is being offered as a alpha version.
>See the [`arduino-cli` github site][14] for more information.

### Step 1: Install arduino-cli - DONE
The the [`arduino-cli` github site][14] give you a choose of installing the "stable"
version or the latest source.
I'm using the latest source and will update frequently as it evolves.

>**NOTE:** `arduino-cli` is writen in the [Go language][30]
>([golang.org][31]) and is installed via the Go Package Manager.
>To find out more about Go packages, check out [this site][29].

```bash
# install the go language
sudo apt install golang-go

# install GOPATH variable and restart your shell
echo "export GOPATH=$HOME/src/go_code" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# install the arduino-cli tool
go get -u github.com/arduino/arduino-cli

# put the arduino-cli executable in your PATH
ln -s $GOPATH/bin/arduino-cli ~/bin/arduino-cli
```

### Step 1A: Updating arduino-cli - DONE
`go get` will install the package in the first directory listed at `$GOPATH`
(an environment variable which might contain a colon separated list of directories).

You can use `go get -u <package>` to update existing packages.
You can also use `go get -u all` to update all packages in your `$GOPATH`.

```bash
# update the arduino-cli tool
go get -u github.com/arduino/arduino-cli
```

### Step 2: Create the .cli-config.yml File - DONE
I found out the hard way about the **non-existance** of the `.cli-config.yml` file.
There is no good documentation on this file or what it does within `arduino-cli`
but I found some hints on the video "[Tutorial on the Arduino Command Line Interface (CLI)][21]"
(at around 2:37 minutes)

But the most insight came when I ran the following commands:

```bash
# dump out the configuration file but with debug on for more information
$ arduino-cli config dump --debug
INFO[0000] Initiating configuration
INFO[0000] Unserializing configurations from /home/jeff/src/go_code/bin/.cli-config.yml
WARN[0000] Error reading config, using default configuration  error="open /home/jeff/src/go_code/bin/.cli-config.yml: no such file or directory"
WARN[0000] Did not manage to get config file, using default configuration  error="open /home/jeff/src/go_code/bin/.cli-config.yml: no such file or directory"
INFO[0000] Checking if CLI is Bundled into the IDE
INFO[0000] Candidate IDE Directory: /home/jeff/src/go_code/bin
INFO[0000] CLI is not bundled into the IDE
INFO[0000] Configuration set
INFO[0000] arduino-cli-0.3.3-alpha.preview
INFO[0000] Starting root command preparation (`arduino`)
INFO[0000] Formatter set
INFO[0000] Executing `arduino config dump`
proxy_type: auto
sketchbook_path: /home/jeff/Arduino
arduino_data: /home/jeff/.arduino15
board_manager: null
```

This says the `.cli-config.yml` doesn't exist and it uses "sketchbook_path: /home/jeff/Arduino".
After some further exploring, I concluded that
`arduino-cli config init` could create the file I need:

```bash
# create the configuration file
$ arduino-cli config init

Config file PATH: /home/jeff/src/go_code/bin/.cli-config.yml

# what is in the configuration file
 cat /home/jeff/src/go_code/bin/.cli-config.yml

proxy_type: auto
sketchbook_path: /home/jeff/Arduino
arduino_data: /home/jeff/.arduino15
board_manager: null
```

This isn't what I want.
If I don't change this,
loading of libraries will be within `/home/jeff/Arduino`
and not `/home/jeff/src/arduino/sketchbooks` where I want them.
I editted the file to look like this:

```yml
proxy_type: auto
sketchbook_path: /home/jeff/src/arduino/sketchbooks
arduino_data: /home/jeff/.arduino15
board_manager: null
```

Execute `arduino-cli config dump --debug` again and you will see the changes.

### Step 3: Update & Upgrade arduino-cli - DONE
If you are running a fresh install of the `arduino-cli`,
you probably need to update the platform indexes
(you'll see these indexes in `~/.ardunio15`) by running:

```bash
# update package index of cores
$ arduino-cli core update-index
Updating index: package_index.json downloaded

# shows the list of installed platforms
$ arduino-cli core list
ID                   	Installed	Latest	Name

```

### Step 4: Find the Board's FQBN (Fully Qualified Board Name) - DONE
First step is to just connect ESP8266/NodeMCU board to your PCs
via a USB cable and run a command to sense the board:

```bash
# sense the board
$ arduino-cli board list
FQBN    Port        	ID       	Board Name
    	/dev/ttyUSB0	10c4:ea60	unknown
```

This wasn't much help since `arduino-cli` couldn't detect the board type.
We know the board is some type of NodeMCU with a ESP8266.
Let's list available cores matching 'nodemcu':

```bash
# list all boards matching 'nodemcu'
$ arduino-cli board listall nodemcu
Board Name                  	FQBN
NodeMCU 0.9 (ESP-12 Module) 	esp8266:esp8266:nodemcu
NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)	esp8266:esp8266:nodemcuv2
NodeMCU-32S                 	esp32:esp32:nodemcu-32s
```

My board is the "NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)", and so,
we now have its coresponding Fully Qualified Board Name (FQBN)
of `esp8266:esp8266:nodemcuv2`.
This gives us the needed information to complile the sketch.

### Step 5: Load Needed Libraries - DONE
The example we are doing requires several additional libraries which are not
pre-installed in the Arduino IDE or the `arduino-cli`.
You can install them within the Arduino IDE, for example,
via **Tools** > **Manage Libraries...** > enter "arduino-timer" and install.
I show below how to do a library install via a`arduino-cli`,
and they will be place in `$HOME/src/arduino/sketechbooks/libraries`
(assuming you updated the `.cli-config.yml` file in the above step.

The `arduino-cli` command we will use to install libraries is `arduino-cli lib ...`:

```bash
# help message for arduino-cli lib
$ arduino-cli lib help
Arduino commands about libraries.

Usage:
  arduino-cli lib [command]

Examples:
  arduino-cli lib install AudioZero
  arduino-cli lib update-index

Available Commands:
  download     Downloads one or more libraries without installing them.
  install      Installs one of more specified libraries into the system.
  list         Shows a list of all installed libraries.
  search       Searchs for one or more libraries data.
  uninstall    Uninstalls one or more libraries.
  update-index Updates the libraries index.
  upgrade      Upgrades installed libraries.

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for lib

Global Flags:
      --config-file string   The custom config file (if not specified ./.cli-config.yml will be used).
      --debug                Enables debug output (super verbose, used to debug the CLI).
      --format string        The output format, can be [text|json]. (default "text")

Use "arduino-cli lib [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

One of the libraries to be installed is `arduino-timer`.
You can see how this is done below:

```bash
# search for a library with 'arduino-timer' in its name
$ arduino-cli lib search arduino-timer
Name: "arduino-timer"
  Author:  Michael Contreras
  Maintainer:  Michael Contreras
  Sentence:  Timer library for delaying function calls

# install the desired library
$ arduino-cli lib install "arduino-timer"
arduino-timer@1.0.0 downloaded
Installed arduino-timer@1.0.0
```

I'll use this non-trivial example sketch, [ntp-clock.ino][20],
which makes use of a ESP8266/NodeMCU + 7-segment LED display board.
Let's install the required libraries for the sketch `ntp-clock.ino`:

```bash
# install all your required libraries
arduino-cli lib install "arduino-timer"
arduino-cli lib install "Adafruit GFX Library"
arduino-cli lib install "Adafruit LED Backpack Library"
arduino-cli lib install "Time"
arduino-cli lib install "Timezone"

# or
arduino-cli lib install "arduino-timer" "Adafruit GFX Library" "Adafruit LED Backpack Library" "Time" "Timezone"
```

To remove all these libraries, just use the following command:
`arduino-cli lib uninstall Adafruit_GFX_Library Adafruit_LED_Backpack_Library arduino-timer Time Timezone`.

### Step 6: Compiling the Sketch - DONE
The `arduino-cli` tool also supports compiling and loading of the sketch.
hear is more information on compiling:

```bash
# help message for arduino-cli compiler
$ arduino-cli help compile
Compiles Arduino sketches.

Usage:
  arduino-cli compile [flags]

Examples:
  arduino-cli compile -b arduino:avr:uno /home/user/Arduino/MySketch

Flags:
      --build-cache-path string    Builds of 'core.a' are saved into this path to be cached and reused.
      --build-path string          Path where to save compiled files. If omitted, a directory will be created in the default temporary path of your OS.
      --build-properties strings   List of custom build properties separated by commas. Or can be used multiple times for multiple properties.
  -b, --fqbn string                Fully Qualified Board Name, e.g.: arduino:avr:uno
  -h, --help                       help for compile
  -o, --output string              Filename of the compile output.
      --preprocess                 Print preprocessed code to stdout instead of compiling.
      --quiet                      Optional, supresses almost every output.
      --show-properties            Show all build properties used instead of compiling.
  -v, --verbose                    Optional, turns on verbose mode.
      --vid-pid string             When specified, VID/PID specific build properties are used, if boards supports them.
      --warnings string            Optional, can be "none", "default", "more" and "all". Defaults to "none". Used to tell gcc which warning level to use (-W flag). (default "none")

Global Flags:
      --config-file string   The custom config file (if not specified ./.cli-config.yml will be used).
      --debug                Enables debug output (super verbose, used to debug the CLI).
      --format string        The output format, can be [text|json]. (default "text")
```

To compile the sketch we have to run the compile command
with the proper board's FQBN (Fully Qualified Board Name) we just got in the previous command.
Now we are going to compile the [ntp-clock.ino][20] sketch.

```bash
# compile the sketch
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp8266:esp8266:nodemcuv2 ~/src/arduino/sketchbooks/ntp-clock
```

This will create two file,
`ntp-clock.esp8266.esp8266.nodemcuv2.bin` and `ntp-clock.esp8266.esp8266.nodemcuv2.elf`,
within `~/src/ntp-clock`.
The `.bin` file is the firmware that will be uploaded into the microcontroller.
The `.elf` file is a executable and linkable format (elf)
formated file used when object file linking is required.

### Step 7: Fix the `esptool` - DONE - CHECK THIS
I had to do a fix the [`esptool.py` tool][24] (ROM bootloader for ESP8266 & ESP32)
since I got the following error while doing an
upload to an ESP32 (ESP8266 appears to work fine):
"Error: fork/exec /home/jeff/.arduino15/packages/esp32/tools/esptool/2.3.1/esptool: no such file or directory".
The fix is the following:

```bash
# make esp8266 esptool executable
cd ~/.arduino15/packages/esp32/tools/esptool_py/2.6.0/
cp esptool.py esptool
chmod a+x esptool

# make esp32 esptool executable
chmod a+x /home/jeff/.arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/1.0.1/tools/esptool.py
```

### Step 8: UpLoad the Sketch - DONE
We can now upload the sketch and see the board in operation.

```bash
# help information concerning upload
$ arduino-cli help upload
Upload Arduino sketches.

Usage:
  arduino-cli upload [flags]

Examples:
  arduino-cli upload /home/user/Arduino/MySketch

Flags:
  -b, --fqbn string    Fully Qualified Board Name, e.g.: arduino:avr:uno
  -h, --help           help for upload
  -i, --input string   Input file to be uploaded.
  -p, --port string    Upload port, e.g.: COM10 or /dev/ttyACM0

  -t, --verify         Verify uploaded binary after the upload.

Global Flags:
      --config-file string   The custom config file (if not specified ./.cli-config.yml will be used).
      --debug                Enables debug output (super verbose, used to debug the CLI).
      --format string        The output format, can be [text|json]. (default "text")
```

As before, we need to provide the FQBN, but also specify the serial port used by the board:
We'll do this for the [ntp-clock.ino][20] sketch:

```bash
# upload the compile sketch
$ arduino-cli upload --fqbn esp8266:esp8266:nodemcuv2 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 ~/src/arduino/sketchbooks/ntp-clock
No new serial port detected.
Uploading 267072 bytes from /home/jeff/src/ntp-clock/ntp-clock.esp8266.esp8266.nodemcuv2.bin to flash at 0x00000000
................................................................................ [ 30% ]
................................................................................ [ 61% ]
................................................................................ [ 91% ]
.....................                                                            [ 100% ]
```

### Step X: Uninstall arduino-cli
```bash
# uninstall the arduino-cli tool
rm -r -f $GOPATH/src/github.com/arduino/arduino-cli

# remove executable in your PATH
rm ~/bin/arduino-cli
```

----

## Using Makefile
You'll find Makefile template for the [Arduino board family][26],
the [Atmel (now Microchip) AVR family][25],
[Espressif Systems ESP family][17] ([there is more than one][27]), and others.
The harsh reality is that there isn't single Makefile template for all
the boards & processors leveraging the Arduino IDE.
Ideally, I want to have a simple to understand Makefile for
the specific board/processor families I'm interested in.
There are several "best practices" you'll find them here:

* [Practical Makefiles, by example](http://nuclear.mutantstargoat.com/articles/make/)
* [Make: Building AVR And Arduino Firmware On The Command Line](https://flyingcarsandstuff.com/2017/11/make-building-avr-and-arduino-firmware-on-the-command-line/)
* [Makefiles, Best Practices](https://danyspin97.org/blog/makefiles-best-practices/)
* [ESP8266 - First Steps](http://smallbits.marshall-tribe.net/blog/2016/05/07/esp8266-first-steps)

You'll find that the simple Makefile below
will support our example sketch [ntp-clock.ino][20] when using `arduino-cli`:

```bash
# programs name
PROG = ntp-clock

# fully qualified board name (FQBN)
FQBN = esp8266:esp8266:nodemcuv2

# serial port used by the board
PORT = /dev/ttyUSB0

#ESPTOOL = /home/jeff/.arduino15/packages/esp32/tools/esptool_py/2.6.1/esptool.py
ESPTOOL = /home/jeff/.arduino15/packages/esp8266/hardware/esp8266/2.5.2/tools/esptool/esptool


# string within names give to .bin and .elf files
VAR = $(shell echo $(FQBN) | tr ':' '.')

# compile and firmware flashing commands
CC = arduino-cli compile --fqbn $(FQBN)
UPLOAD = arduino-cli upload --fqbn $(FQBN) --port $(PORT)


.PHONY: build upload clean erase

build:                                          # build the binary executable
	$(CC) $(CURDIR)

upload:                                         # up load the binary executable
	$(UPLOAD) $(CURDIR)

erase:                                          # erase the entire flash
	$(ESPTOOL) --port $(PORT) erase_flash

size:                                           # determine the flash size
	$(ESPTOOL) --port $(PORT) flash_id

clean:                                          # delete all binaries and object viles
	rm --force $(PROG).$(VAR).bin $(PROG).$(VAR).elf
```

But there is a problem with focusing my Makefile efforts on the `arduino-cli`.
It just is not mature and stable enough for the wide range
of libraries and functions I would like it to support.
You really need to leverage directly the ESP tools that the Arduino IDE uses.

To get what I needed, I ended up settling on on [makeEspArduino][27] as my Makefile.
While not as simple as I wished,
it does seem to be very functional and well supported.
It's major down side is its lack of good documentation.
Only materials I have found are:

* [makeEspArduino: README File](https://github.com/plerup/makeEspArduino/blob/master/README.md)
* [makeEspArduino: A makefile for ESP8266 and ESP32 Arduino projects](https://libraries.io/github/plerup/makeEspArduino)

**See internet-of-things-clock.md for text on makeEspArduino Makefile.**
