# Meshtastic
[Meshtastic][01] is a project that lets you use inexpensive ($30 ish) GPS radios as an extensible, long battery life, secure, mesh GPS communicator. These radios are great for hiking, skiing, paragliding - essentially any hobby where you donâ€™t have reliable internet access. Each member of your private mesh can always see the location and distance of all other members and any text messages sent to your group chat.
