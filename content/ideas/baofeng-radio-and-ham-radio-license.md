I have already bought the
[Baofeng UV-5R+ 136-174 400-480 MHz FM Transceiver][05]
in the hopes of hacking for something useful ($35 .... why not),
but I have been dragging my feet about getting a amateur radio license.
I then read the Hackaday article "[Sage Advice for the New Ham][03]"
and "[Get Your Amateur Radio License Already][04]".
I told myself it was time.
After a quick look at the [pool of test questions for the license exam][02],
I suspect I could pass the Technician Class, maybe even the General Class,
going in cold, without studying
(by the way, no need to learn Morse Code these day).
If you needs some additional motivation for taking the test, check out these sites:

>**NOTE:** The Baofeng UV-5R has now been sort of superseded by a new model,
>the [Baofeng F8HP][07].

# Baofeng UV-5R+ 136-174 400-480 MHz FM Transceiver
This is an inexpensive Chinese hand held 5 watt radio,
capable of transmitting and receiving on the 2-meter and 70-cm bands.
Additionally, it can receive on standard commercial FM frequencies as well as weather band!
I bought it because its programmability and others have successfully hacked it

The [Federal Communications Commission has adopted a $35 fee][09]
for new amateur radio licenses, license renewals, and changes to existing licenses, like vanity call signs.
While $35 isn't cheap, it's not the end of the world,
and it's better than the $50 fee that the FCC was originally proposing.

# History of Ham
The origin of the term "Ham" is not clear but the prevailing theory is the following.
In the early part of the 20th Century,
Radio was proving its usefulness and electronic experimenters would homebrew their own radio stations,
and begin broadcasting.
The burgeoning commercial radio broadcasters would compete head to head
for the radio crystal listening audience (themselves early adopters).
Broadcast professionals would refer to the homebrewers as "Hams"
as in bad actors.
Through the power of lobbying organizations,
the Hams of the day were relegated to one small part of radio spectrum.
In the 1920's, Hiram Percy Maxim saw the value of a public with radios transceivers for emergency communications,
and founded the American Radio Relay League (ARRL).

# Amateur Radio Weak Signal Communication
The FT8 digital mode is the latest in a series of weak signal applications for amateur radio.
Conceived originally for enhancing esoteric propagaint modes such as high speed meteor scatter and moonbounce,
Joe Taylor (K1JT) developed a series of applications including FSK144, JT6M, JT65, and JT9.
When FT8, jointly developed by Joe Taylor and Steve Franke (K9AN),
was announced it was described as being designed for,
“[multi-hop Es where signals may be weak and fading, openings may be short, and you want fast completion of reliable, confirmable QSO’s.][08]”
