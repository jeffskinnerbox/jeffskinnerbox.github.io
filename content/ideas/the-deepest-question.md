What the hell is going on?

In 1960, [Eugene Wigner][01]
published a now classic article on the philosophy of mathematics and of physics,
"[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences][02]"
(reprint of the original article [here][03])

that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true.
