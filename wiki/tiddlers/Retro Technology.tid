[[Shive Wave Machine|http://techchannel.att.com/play-video.cfm/2011/3/7/AT&T-Archives-Similarities-of-Wave-Behavior]]
- This mechanical wave generator illustrates wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection and impedance matching.

[[Harmonic Analyzer|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAsM30MAHLg]]
- A nineteenth century mechanical computer that performed Fourier analysis by using gears, springs and levers to calculate with sines and cosines.
And of course, someone in the maker community has made a
[[plywood version of the harmonic analyzer|http://hackaday.com/2016/04/11/fourier-machine-mimics-michelson-original-in-plywood/]].

AT&T produced the video "[[Seeing the Digital Future|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avHo0-qU8xo]]" and
brags about things like the Data-Phone which could transmit
at up to a bit-rate of 110 bits per second.

[[Mechanical computation|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1i-dnAH9Y4]] for weapons fire control computer aboard Navy Ships is a thing of the past.
These mechanical mavels, such as the
[[Differential Analyzers|http://www.meccano.us/differential_analyzers/index.html]]
can even solve differential equations.
While such machanical devices can easily be replaced
numberical analysis perfromed on a digital computer,
[[some people still like to build them|http://hackaday.com/2016/08/08/differential-analyzer-cranks-out-math-like-a-champ-at-vcf-2016/]].

[[Popular Electronics Magazine|http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Popular-Electronics-Guide.htm]]
- Popular Electronics was created in 1954 by Ziff-Davis Publishing for an audience of electronics hobbyists and experimenters.
It became Computers & Electronics in November, 1982

[[AmericanRadioHistory.com|http://www.americanradiohistory.com/index.htm]]

What feels like a long time ago, you could drive down the highway, particularly within
[[major cities or hilly mountainous areas|https://99percentinvisible.org/article/vintage-skynet-atts-abandoned-long-lines-microwave-tower-network/]],
you would see C-band (4-6 GHz) microwave relay
[[parabolic horn-reflector antennas|https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hogg_horn_antennas.jpg]]
(aka Hogg horn antenna) mounted on large towers.
These [[AT&T Long Lines microwave tower sites|http://www.drgibson.com/towers/]]
networked the continental United States and supplied
the needed capacity that couldn't be provided by twisted pair and coax cables,
in a age before fiber optic cables.
The [[AT&T Long Lines coast-to-coast microwave system|https://hackaday.com/2017/07/10/horns-across-america-the-att-long-lines-network/]] was inaugurated in 1951.
But this public network couldn't meet the more demanding requirements of th military.
For this, another, somewhat hidden,
[[cold war infrastructure network|https://coldwar-c4i.net/AUTOVON/index.html]] was created call the
[[Automatic Voice Network (AUTOVON)|https://hackaday.com/2020/09/09/autovon-a-phone-system-fit-for-the-military/]].
Never the less,
[[AT&T did have nuclear-hardened secure communications stations|https://coldwar-c4i.net/ATT_Project/index.html]],
including [[microwave sites|http://www.engineeringradio.us/blog/2009/07/cold-war-relic-att-long-lines-microwave-site-kingston-ny/]].
I remember one of them as [[Netcong|https://www.newjerseyhills.com/mt_olive_chronicle/news/secret-underground-facility-had-flanders-address-netcong-name-and-roxbury-location/article_964c675e-080d-5bae-8ece-ac30cfd7ea32.html]].
While I never entered [[Ma Bell's bunker|https://www.clui.org/newsletter/winter-2017/going-deep#:~:text=For%20more%20than%20a%20decade,in%20Bedminister%20and%20Basking%20Ridge.]],
I was told that it was from here AT&T would operate its network in the event of a nuclear attach.

[[Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS)|http://hackaday.com/2014/12/02/retrotechtacular-ma-bells-advanced-mobile-phone-service-amps/]] is the first-generation cellular technology from AT&T.
But this was presided in the 1940's by the [[Mobile Telephone Service (MTS)|https://hackaday.com/2020/03/13/retrotechtacular-mobile-phones-1940s-style]].

[[The Boy Electrician|http://www.tayloredge.com/museum/museum/TheBoyElectrician.pdf]] is an introduction to electricity and magnetism from a time when you could still build things at home that worked just like commercial gear.

[[Foxhole Radio|http://bizarrelabs.com/foxhole.htm]]
where built by GI's, during World War Two, which took advantage of readily available materials.

From the mid-40s until the 90s,
[[Heathkit|http://hackaday.com/2014/12/22/the-heathkit-mystery/]]
was the brand for electronic kits ranging from test equipment, ~HiFis, amateur radio equipment, to computers.
As there [[new branding says|https://shop.heathkit.com/shop]],
in some ways, Heathkit invented DIY.
Their departure was a tragic loss,
but there are some faint signs they may be making a
[[come back|https://www.heathkit.com/heathkit-faq.html]].
People still celerbrate the glory days of Heathkit by
[[rebuilding the old kits|https://hackaday.com/2020/06/26/reliving-heathkits-glory-days-through-a-teardown-and-rebuild/]].

A [[teleprinter|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcMHam54EOI#t=516]]
(teletypewriter, Teletype or TTY) is an electromechanical typewriter that can be used to send and receive typed messages from point to point and point to multipoint over various types of communications channels.
Teleprinters were invented in order to send and receive messages
without the need for operators trained in the use of Morse code,
and have been [[around since at least the 1930's|https://hackaday.com/2020/04/15/logging-into-linux-with-a-1930s-teletype/]].
At there core, they were
[[mechanical UARTs|http://hackaday.com/2015/11/13/retrotechtacular-a-mechanical-uart/]],
converting serial bits pumping out at 110 baud and
converting the encoding to letter strikes on the paper.
Check out [[this video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NuvwndwYSY&index=1&list=PL-_93BVApb5-9eQLTCk9xx16RAGEYHH1q]]
of restoration of a very old [[Model 19 Teletype|http://www.baudot.net/teletype/M19.htm]].

This training film on [[Basic Telephony|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKfa27PTE_s#t=29]]
(and it's [[part 2|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKvllL2zxGo]])
describes the common household telephone prior to todays digital telephony.

The [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) System|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06drBN8nlWg]],
was designed and built in the 1950s to defend against the threat
of Soviet bombers attacking the continental United States.

The [[UNIX Operating System|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0]]
(over 50 years old now and often compared to
[[GNU, Linux, BSD, and MINIX|https://hackaday.com/2019/11/05/will-the-real-unix-please-stand-up/]])
was developed to make the job of creating software systems easier,
and in general, make the interaction of computers with people easier.
This productivity gain was taken further with the introduction of the
[[Blit|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr1XXvSaVUQ]], an early windowed graphic interface for Unix.

The very first programming language I learned (in 1974) was Basic running on my collages
Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 computer.
In 1963, [[Basic was developed by Dartmouth|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYPNjSoDrqw]]
mathematicians as a teaching tool for undergraduates.
At the time, teaching undergrtaduates computer programming was generally not done.

Silicon Valley, or as it was formerlly know,
[[Valley of the Hearts Delight|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_Valley]],
is in some ways retro.
To understand why, see the article "[[To Invent the Future, You Must Understand the Past|https://medium.com/backchannel/why-silicon-valley-will-continue-to-rule-c0cbb441e22f]]",
and watch the video "[[Triumph of the Nerds|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1yzXkH5Pfo]]"
to discover how Silicon Valley made it OK to be a nerd.

Before [[Pong|http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3900/the_history_of_pong_avoid_missing_.php?print=1]],
there was [[Tennis for Two|http://www.engineering.com/DesignerEdge/DesignerEdgeArticles/ArticleID/10252/The-Past-and-Future-of-Video-Games.aspx]]
at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|http://www.stonybrook.edu/libspecial/videogames/tennis.html]],
the first video game.
Tennis for Two consisted of a 5 inch oscilloscope and
an analog computer to simulate the physics of gravity and elasticity in real time.
And of course, some have updated the analog orginal with a
[[digital replacement|http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2008/resurrecting-tennis-for-two-a-video-game-from-1958/]].

The [[Omega navigational system|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mFAemn1pSw]],
deployed by the United States Navy, was a network of eight (VLF) transmitter
sites spread around the globe using radio frequencies
and phase difference calculations to determine global position.

Some believe Westinghouse built the
[[first electric computer|http://gothamist.com/2015/10/15/grand_central_computer_video.php#photo-1]]
in 1913 and installed it in the sub-basement of
Grand Central Terminal.
Its reminiscent of the the more generalized [[relay computers|https://hackaday.com/2019/12/06/visiting-the-facom-128b-1958-relay-computer/]].
As to a programmable electronic digital computer,
similar todays computers, it is generally believe that
[[Colossus|http://hackaday.com/2016/08/23/colossus-face-to-face-with-the-first-electronic-computer/#more-219341]] was the first.

I graduated High School in 1974,
which placing me in a world between
[[slide rulers and electronic calculators|https://www.sliderulemuseum.com/Calculators.htm]];
[[vacuum tubes and transistors|https://hackaday.com/2019/02/20/retrotechtacular-how-not-to-design-with-transistors/]].
So in High School I experienced electronics shop class with tubes
(yes, [[Shop Class|https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarabrown/2012/05/30/the-death-of-shop-class-and-americas-high-skilled-workforce]]
was a well respect elective in 1974)
but studied transistors exclusively in college.
I used a slide ruler in High School but never used it in college,
preferring a calculator there.
By the way, the [[Pascaline|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h71HAJWnVU]]
was the first successful mechanical calculator.
It was developed in the 1640's by the mathematician Blaise Pascal.
For more on the history and operation of the first personal computer (aka slide rule),
[[check out this site|https://hackaday.com/2015/11/05/slide-rules-were-the-original-personal-computers/]].

[[Slide Rules|http://hackaday.com/2015/11/05/slide-rules-were-the-original-personal-computers/#more-175364]]
were among the first computing tools
(other than the [[teams of calculators|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m13Jrk-cUmo&app=desktop]]
of the [[human kind|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer]]
that gave us things like the
[[Mathematical Tables Project|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Tables_Project]].
The greatest legacy of the project is the
[[Handbook of Mathematical Functions|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Tables_Project]],
a copy of which I still own),
and a simple example of a mechanical analog computer
(not all analog computer are mechanical,
such as the electrical computer [[Westinghouse 1947 AC Network Calculator|https://hackaday.com/2021/02/09/the-modding-restoration-and-demise-of-a-3m-analog-computer/]]
and fluid computers [[MONIAC|http://hackaday.com/2016/04/26/retrotechtacular-moniac/]] and
[[Water Integrator|http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/338106]]
and of course the general purpose [[electrical analog computer|http://www.analogmuseum.org/english/]]).
For generations of engineers, technicians and scientists,
the slide rule (particularly the [[K+E brand|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keuffel_and_Esser]])
was an essential part of their daily lives.
Until, all of a sudden, it wasn't.
In 1972 Hewlett-Packard
[[HP-35|http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/personalsystems/0023/0023history.html]]
came out with the first scientific calculator.
Practically overnight, the slide rule had become obsolete.
Check out the [[history of the HP-35 pocket calculator|http://codex99.com/design/the-hp35.html]].
I currently own, but rarely use, a [[HP 32S II|http://mycalcdb.free.fr/main.php?l=0&id=846]].
Maybe the [[handheld calculator is too on its way out|https://hackaday.com/2020/03/02/the-last-scientific-calculator/]].

As a Freshman engineering student,
I was instructed to to purchase the CRC Standard Mathematical Tables
(which I still have, 22nd edition printed in 1974).
I mainly used it to lookup solution to Integrals and Infinite Series.
Its tables of values for mathematical functions were of little value to me
since they were already being replaced by the handheld calculator.
I came to college with a copy the much more famous
[[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|https://hackaday.com/2015/12/23/before-google-there-was-the-chemical-rubber-company/]].
It was an old copy, even when give to me in 1974.
My high school biology teacher gave it to me as a gift before parting for college.
She told me it would be useful since the values in the book are still relevant despite the books advanced age.
I never used it, but I still have this nearly 100 year old book;
the 13 edition printed in 1928.

It was on [[HP's version|http://www.hpmuseum.org/]]
of this [[first Desktop Computer|http://hackaday.com/2015/12/08/retrotechtacular-a-desktop-computer-from-1965/]]
(I believe it might have been a [[HP 9830A|http://www.hpmuseum.org/hp9830.htm]]
or a [[HP9100|https://hackaday.com/2020/10/02/retrotechtacular-the-5000-40-pound-hp-classroom-computer/]])
that sparked my interest in software coding.
Programming it was only slightly better than working in assembly language.

You would thing that the [[Fax Machine|http://hackaday.com/2016/02/17/faxing-in-1843/]]
couldn't pre-date the telephone, but it appears it does.
[[Fax|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax]],
or it mondern original version
[[radio facsimile|http://hackaday.com/2015/12/22/retrotechtacular-electronic-publishing-in-the-1930s/]],
was introduced in the 1940s.
Fax provided a pre-computer age of transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images).
This was following by the
[[Xerox 914 copier|http://hackaday.com/2016/07/20/retrotechtacular-birds-and-the-bees-document-style/]]
and the [[answering machine|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xROXat5cBDc]]
in the late 1950s.

Speaking of Xerox, it can be claimed that they invented this modern computerized society
at the Palo Alto Research Center in the early 1970s.
How could this be you say, check out the
[[Mother of all Demos|https://hackaday.com/2019/01/03/retrotechtacular-the-mother-of-all-demos-50-years-on/]].

Is the [[World Wide Web (WWW)|http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/08/06/the-worlds-first-website-went-online-25-years-ago-today]]
retrotechnology yet?
I think not but its first browser, [[Mosaic|https://www.wired.com/2010/04/0422mosaic-web-browser/]] is.

The Internet has made the access to
[[commercial information|https://hackaday.com/2021/01/27/before-google-there-was-the-reference-librarian/]],
and for that mattter, even mathematical, physical and chemical data easy.
Back in the day, as in my college years,
I was required to purchase the
[[CRC Handbook of Standard Mathematical Tables|https://www.crcpress.com/CRC-Standard-Mathematical-Tables-and-Formulae-32nd-Edition/Zwillinger/9781439835487]].
As a parting gift for leave for college,
my high school biology teacher gave me
a copy of the 1928 version of the
[[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 3rd Edition|http://hackaday.com/2015/12/23/before-google-there-was-the-chemical-rubber-company/]].
I haven't opened these books in a VERY Long time,
not because they don't contain relevant / useful information,
but the [[Internet makes the book searchable|http://www.hbcpnetbase.com/]].

The [[Lunar Excursion Module (LEM)|http://hackaday.com/2016/02/12/cover-your-glass-a-lesson-in-design-trades/]]
carried astronauts from lunar orbit to the moon’s surface.
There had never been anything quite like it,
and engineers had to overcome many challenges to getting it to a working state.

[[Transmission Lines|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9m2w4DgeVk&feature=youtu.be]]
may not really be retrotech,
but not a hot topic these days, and so may not be well understood.
The pace of this old video is a bit slow by today’s standards,
but the quality of the material presented makes it worth the wait.
In 1956 that the first transatlantic telephone system,
[[Transatlantic Telephone Cable System 1 (TAT-1)|http://hackaday.com/2016/03/18/what-lies-beneath-the-first-transatlantic-communications-cables/]],
is an example of a transmission line.

When I start my career at
[[Bell Labs|https://hackaday.com/2019/02/19/bell-labs-skunk-works-and-the-crowd-sourcing-of-innovation/]]
in the 1970s,
I spent many an hour in and around the Computing Center.
Check out these training videos:
[[Part 1|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMYiktO0D64]] and
[[Part 2|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9aVOIuKVUc]]
How things have changed!

The [[electronic switching system (ESS)|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_switching_system]]
is a telephone connecting operation
that uses digital electronics and computerized control to interconnect telephone circuits.
It replaced the need for telephone operators but the public
had to be trained in its use and operation via
[[films like this|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvvvLzw1XsQ]].

As a space age kid, it is hard for me to accept
that the [[Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC)|http://hackaday.com/2015/02/03/reproducing-a-dsky/]]
(in fact, [[all the guidance computers|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGymMMQbPbo&feature=youtu.be]])
is now retro technology, but it is.
AGC was a digital computer,
with [[rope memory|http://hackaday.com/2016/09/02/decoding-rediscovered-rope-memory-from-the-apollo-guidance-computer/]],
produced for the Apollo program that was
installed on board each Apollo Command Module (CM) and Lunar Module (LM).
Luckily, [[people have rescued the AGC from the dumpster|https://hackaday.com/2019/08/04/apollo-guidance-computer-saved-from-the-scrap-yard/]]
and [[Hackaday has done multiple articles|http://hackaday.com/tag/apollo/]]
on the Apollo space program hardware and
[[software|http://hackaday.com/2016/07/14/riding-shotgun-in-the-apollo-12-lunar-lander/]].
You can even find the [[AGC code on Github|http://qz.com/726338/the-code-that-took-america-to-the-moon-was-just-published-to-github-and-its-like-a-1960s-time-capsule/]],
and you will also discover what lengths the designs went to conserve memory
(e.g. [[calculating sine and cosine in 35 instruction steps|https://hackaday.com/2020/06/12/apollo-11-trig-was-brief/]]).
Despite the navigation technology, it still needed good old retro-technology,
even for its day, to initialize the LM's AGC.
Check out the LM's [[Alignment Optical Telescope|http://hackaday.com/2016/09/06/apollo-the-alignment-optical-telescope/#more-220722]].
And of course, don't forget about the [[guidance and telemetry system for the Saturn V rocket|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mMK6iSZsAs&feature=youtu.be]].

Speaking of the Apollo moon shoot program,
let's not forget about the amazing engineering of the
[[Saturn F-1 Engine|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z37MdvcSaFY]].
As of 2020, over 50 year since sending man to the moon,
this is still the most powerful rocket engine ever created,
delivering 1.5 million pounds of thrust.
You can stand next-to & touch one of these monsters at the
[[Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/f-1-rocket-engine/nasm_A19700271000]].

And before there were astronauts to be a young kids hero,
there there were legionary test pilots like [[Chuck Yeager|https://www.chuckyeager.com/]]
and his first manned supersonic flight of the [[Bell X-1|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_X-1]].
A surprising fact is that if it were not for
[[his lack of a college education|https://hackaday.com/2020/12/10/remembering-chuck-yeager-the-supersonic-legend-whose-wings-were-clipped-by-a-high-school-diploma/]],
Yeager could have joined the astronaut crews.

We all have seen pictures, and some of us can also remember, the Big Board that NASA used at
[[Mission Control|https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/10/going-boldly-what-it-was-like-to-be-an-apollo-flight-controller/]]
for the Apollo program.
You would expect that it was a computer projection of some sort,
but in fact was a complex electro-mechanical design, originating from the
[[Summary Display Projection Room|https://www.nasa.gov/content/restoration-of-apollo-mission-control]],
lovingly called the "Bat Cave".
[[Fran Blanche|https://hackaday.com/2020/10/29/a-look-behind-the-big-boards-at-mission-control-in-the-golden-age-of-nasa/]]
does a great job describing how the magic happened.

Do you remember when computer graphics meet
[[ASCII characters on paper via a teletype terminal|http://hackaday.com/2016/06/28/retrotechtacular-ascii-art-in-the-19th-century/]]?
Well you can still find it in Linux .... [[check out asciiview|http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/aview.1.html]].
Also see [[jp2a|https://github.com/cslarsen/jp2a]],
[[libcaca|http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca]],

and there are
[[others|http://melitamihaljevic.blogspot.com/2012/08/generating-ascii-art-linux-python.html]].
You can even take [[ASCII pictures on your smartphone|https://hackaday.com/2017/11/25/asciicam-make-ascii-art-with-your-phone/]].

[[VHF/UHF Analog TV|http://hackaday.com/2016/06/01/retrotechtacular-fog-over-portland/#more-206555]]
with their mechanical turners can't be found anywhere today.
There is simply no analog channels on the air any more,
making [[TV snow|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(video)]]
a distant memory of the past,
taking with it a [[visual reminder of the big bang|http://www.universetoday.com/25560/the-switch-to-digital-switches-off-big-bang-tv-signal/]].

While on the subject of old time TV,
can you remember when TV test pattern appearing on the three channels late at night?
It appears they where generated by something called a
[[monoscope tube||https://hackaday.com/2019/05/26/vintage-monoscope-tubes-generate-classic-tv-test-patterns-once-again/]].

There was a time when you couldn't hook up anything to the
telephone network without AT&T's OK
- when the [[Bell System|http://www.corp.att.com/history/history3.html]] was considered a
[[Natural Monopoly|http://www.watier.org/kathy/papers/Telephonenetwork.pdf]].
[[Hush-A-Phone|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush-A-Phone_Corp._v._United_States]] didn't want to challege AT&T's monopoly status
but did want want to connect a simple physical device
to the network.
This was the first step in de-regulating the telecommunication business,
to be followed by Tom Carter's challenge to AT&T with the [[Carterfone|http://hackaday.com/2016/08/16/retrotechtacular-tom-carter-revolutionized-your-phone/]].
These two events state the stage for the [[breakup of the Bell System|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System]].

There was a time, in the days of the Bell System,
when ''you could not'' connect anything you please to the telephone,
eclectically or even mechanically.
This restriction forced the creation some strange designs for things like
[[telephone answering machines|https://hackaday.com/2018/07/12/the-bad-old-days-of-telephone-answering-machines/]].
This began to change when a Texan named
[[Tom Carter sued Ma Bell|https://hackaday.com/2016/08/16/retrotechtacular-tom-carter-revolutionized-your-phone/]].

Do you remember [[dial-up Internet access| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access]]?
Do you remember the
[[dial-up hand-shake sounds|http://www.windytan.com/2012/11/the-sound-of-dialup-pictured.html]]
the modems made?
Have you ever seen the [[insides of a modem|https://hackaday.com/2019/03/29/teardown-of-a-50-year-old-modem/]]?
What about the [[acoustic coupler|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_coupler]]
used as an interface device between your computer
and the phone line?
And of course, before we had phone lines to exchange data,
we had magnetic tapes, but that is another story called
[[MUDPIE|https://hackaday.com/2018/12/01/retrotechtacular-before-the-internet-mudpie/]].

In the days before computer modeling of physical processes
could be done at large scale,
you had to perform a physical experiment.
One of the largest such experiment was [[ATLAS-1|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATLAS-I]].
This [[devices, really a huge apperatus,|https://hackaday.com/2018/03/09/how-to-test-a-b-52-against-emp-project-atlas-i/]]
was to measure the effects of
[[electromagnetic pulse (EMP)|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse]]

While no long needed due to todays computer technology,

Robotic are now impacting our working and home life but talk of this robotic world
dates back many years.
Westinghouse had its [[Elektro|https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Elektro]] at the 1939 World Fair
and the follow on version called
[[Televox|https://hackaday.com/2019/04/12/televox-the-pasts-robot-of-the-future/]]
in the 1940's.
By today's standards, none of this would be called a robot.
And let us not forget what the 1960's TV show "[[Lost in Space|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_in_Space]]" brought us.
It was the [[Class M-3 Model B-9 General Utility Non-Theorizing Environmental Control Robot|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_(Lost_in_Space)]].

I personally did not see much value in the
[[earliest mobile computing device|https://paleotronic.com/2019/09/28/from-pocket-computers-to-palmtops-an-early-history-of-mobile-telecomputing/]]
but I did proudly carry an [[AMP|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Mobile_Phone_System]]
enabled [[Motorola StarTAC Flip Cell Phone|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_StarTAC]]
and around the same time was an early adopter of the
[[personal digital assistant (PDA)|https://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/personal-digital-assistant]].
My first purchase was the [[Sharp Wizard OS-5500|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIFA4Xl03-k]].
I later move on to the [[Palm series of PDA|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_(PDA)]]
starting with the [[PalmPilot Personal|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk0yQwl5gz4]]
and ultimately the [[Palm Treo 750|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFGi88zvS8o]].
I lusted after the [[HP-200LX|https://hackaday.com/2020/12/21/the-first-real-palmtop/]] but never purchased one.

I don't miss my [[floppy disk|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk]] days.
They where painful slow, limited in storage, took up too much time & space, and easily damaged or corrupted.
This technology, invented and first commercially available from IBM in 1971,
was critical to the success of the first personal computer,
but by 2006, computers were rarely manufactured with installed floppy disk drives.
As it turns out, though, even in 2020 the
[[Boeing 747-400 still relies on floppies|https://hackaday.com/2020/08/12/floppy-disks-still-used-to-update-747-flight-software/]].

Big iron is a slang word commonly used to describe a very large, expensive and extremely fast computer.
It is often used to refer to oversized computers such as Cray’s supercomputer or IBM’s mainframe.
So what is inside big iron?
Take a look at this [[teardown of a $250,000 1991 vintage IBM 9121 TCM Processor module|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ3oJlt4GrI&feature=youtu.be]]
from a System/390 ES9000 Enterprise Server mainframe computer,

While it still lives among us, you could argue that in this wireless world
[[Ethernet technology is retro-technology at the age of 40+ years|https://hackaday.com/2020/10/19/ethernet-at-40-from-a-napkin-sketch-to-multi-gigabit-links/]].
This technology originated at [[Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)|https://www.parc.com/about-parc/parc-history/]]
a based on an exciting digital satellite technology called [[ALOHAnet|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALOHAnet]]
that I learned about in an advance communications course in graduate school.
