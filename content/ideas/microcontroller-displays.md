# LED Matrix
I choose one of the many versions of the [MAX7219 dot matrix module][08]
8x8 dot matrix common cathode LED display modules for my display.
I Choose this because of the because of its modest size
(Module size = length x width x height = 12.8 x 3.2 x 1.3 cm),
low working voltage (5V),
and you can chain 2 or more together to create a [scrolling display][10].
I specific used the MAX7219 Dot Matrix Module 4-in-1 Display
(at [Amazon][06] or much cheaper at [Banggood][07] and where I got mine).

# OLED Display
An organic light-emitting diode (OLED or Organic LED),
also known as an organic EL (organic electroluminescent) diode,
is a light-emitting diode (LED) containing an electroluminescent
film of organic compound that emits light in response to an electric current.

OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens,
computer monitors, smartphones, etc.
OLEDs can be made flexible and transparent, with transparent displays being used in smartphones
with optical fingerprint scanners and flexible displays being used in foldable smartphones.

An OLED display works without a backlight because it emits visible light.
Thus, it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display (LCD).
In low ambient light conditions, an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD.
