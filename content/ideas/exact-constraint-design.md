Exact-Constraint Design
provides you the principles and techniques for desiging precision machines.
Rather than exclusively relying on precision parts, this method shows how to
restrict degrees of freedom by looking at the basic kinematic connections between parts.
This can save using precision rails and bearings only in the places where absolutely necessary.

# Accuracy & Precision
In the world of measurement,
accuracy is closeness of the measurements to a specific value,
while precision is the closeness of the measurements to each other.

* **Precision** is a description of random errors, a measure of statistical variability.
* **Accurcy** is a description of systematic errors, a measure of statistical bias;
low accuracy causes a difference between a result and a "true" value. (ISO calls this _trueness_).
So high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness.
