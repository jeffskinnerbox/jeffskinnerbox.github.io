## RFzero
The RFzero is a multi-purpose GPS controlled RF unit.
It can be used as a beacon (IBP, SPB, CW, FST4W, FT4, FT8, JS8, JT9, PI4, WSPR, …),
signal generator, VFO, QO-100 dual LO, low cost GPSDO, e.g. for 10 MHz or 49,152 MHz for the IC-9700,
or … Furthermore, is the RFzero an Arduino compatible platform.
o it is possible for you to write or modify the software yourself.
More than 20 programs, Arduino sketches, are integrated into the Arduino IDE for easy upload to the RFzero.
