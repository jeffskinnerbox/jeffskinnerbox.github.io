## Bug Zapper Racket Fly Swatter
I purchased a $4 [Electronic Fly Swatter from Harbor Freight Tools][01]
for the sole purpose of repurposing its electronics.
To keep it cheap and samll,
[it works using simple principle][02], much like the Joule Thief.
It can put out about 600V,
but some people have claimed to modification it to create [20,000V][03] and even [40,000V][04].

# Electric Oscillator
An electronic oscillator is an electronic circuit that produces a periodic, oscillating electronic signal, often a sine wave or a square wave.
Oscillators convert direct current (DC) from a power supply to an alternating current (AC) signal.

## Tank Circuit

## Relaxation Oscillator
A relaxation oscillator is a nonlinear electronic oscillator circuit that produces a nonsinusoidal repetitive output signal, such as a triangle wave or square wave.
The circuit consists of a feedback loop containing a switching device such as a transistor, comparator, relay, op amp, or a negative resistance device like a tunnel diode, that repetitively charges a capacitor or inductor through a resistance until it reaches a threshold level, then discharges it again.

### Pearson–Anson Oscillator
Maybe the simples relaxation oscillator is
resistive/capacitive circuit relaxation oscillator with a neon lamp as the threshold device
called a Pearson–Anson oscillator, neon lamp oscillator, or sawtooth oscillator.

Like other relaxation oscillators, the neon bulb oscillator has poor frequency stability, but it can be synchronized (entrained) to an external periodic voltage applied in series with the neon bulb. Even if the external frequency is different from the natural frequency of the oscillator, the peaks of the applied signal can exceed the breakdown threshold of the bulb, discharging the capacitor prematurely, so that the period of the oscillator becomes locked to the applied signal.

The forced neon bulb oscillator was the first system in which chaotic behavior was observed by
Balthasar van der Pol and Jan van der Mark but didn't realize its significance at the time

[Chaos Theroy has a long history][06].
While studing weather systems, Lorenz had rediscovered the chaotic behavior of a nonlinear system in 1961
is genrerally given credit for its discovery but Henri Poincare made observations before him.

### Capacitor Resonance
### Inductor Resonance
### Resonant Frequency
### Self Resonant Frequency
### Magnet Wire
[Magnet wire][07] is a copper or aluminium wire coated with a very thin layer of insulation.
It is used in the construction of transformers, inductors, motors, generators, speakers,
electromagnets, and other applications that require tight coils of insulated wire.
The wire itself is typically fully [annealed][08], electrolytically refined copper.
The insulation is typically made of tough polymer film materials
(typically not enamel wire dispite often being called "enameled wire").
Both common copper wires and magnet wire are same by conduct,
but the magnet copper wire is specially coated with thin and high heat absorbing material.
Thin insulated material help to make more turns in a short area and capable for heat absorb.

# Electrical Resonant Transformer
A resonant transformer is one of the [many transformer types][05], but in this case,
one or both windings has a capacitor across it, causing it to functions as a tuned circuit.
Used at radio frequencies, as in a Tesla coil,
resonant transformers can function as high Q factor bandpass filters.
The transformer bandwidth can be adjusted by varying the coupling (mutual inductance).
One common form resonant tansformer is the IF (intermediate frequency) transformer,
used in superheterodyne radio receivers,
ballasts for gas discharge lamps,
and switching power supplies.

## Flyback Transformer
A flyback transformer (FBT), also called a line output transformer (LOPT)
was initially designed to generate high voltage sawtooth signals at a relatively high frequency.
The flyback transformer circuit was invented as a means of controlling the horizontal movement of the electron beam in a cathode ray tube (CRT). Unlike conventional transformers, a flyback transformer is not fed with a signal of the same waveshape as the intended output current.

## Tesla Coil
A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit designed by inventor Nikola Tesla in 1891.
t is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity.

In fact, many operate using normal air which is over 75% N2.
Normal air has a property known as super radiance.
This means that air can produce a laser beam without bouncing light with mirrors that most lasers require.

## Breakdown Voltage
The breakdown voltage of an insulator is the minimum voltage that causes a portion of an insulator
to become electrically conductive.

Paschen's law is an equation that gives the breakdown voltage, that is,
the voltage necessary to start a discharge or electric arc, between two electrodes in a gas
as a function of pressure and gap length.
