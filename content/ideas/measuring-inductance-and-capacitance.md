# Background
[Faraday's law of induction][01] (generally called Faraday's law)
is a basic law of electromagnetism predicting how a magnetic field will interact
with an electric circuit to produce an [electromotive force (EMF)][03]
This phenomenon is known as [electromagnetic induction][02].
It is the fundamental operating principle of transformers, inductors,
and many types of electrical motors, generators and solenoids.

Devices (also known as [transducers][04]) provide an EMF by converting other forms of energy into electrical energy,
such as batteries (which convert chemical energy), or generators (which convert mechanical energy).
An inductor is a transducer that converts changing magntic field into electrical energy.

From Faraday's law of induction, any change in magnetic field through a circuit induces an electromotive force (EMF) (voltage) in the conductors, a process known as electromagnetic induction. This induced voltage created by the changing current has the effect of opposing the change in current. This is stated by Lenz's law, and the voltage is called back EMF.

Inductance is the tendency of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in the electric current flowing through it.
The flow of electric current creates a magnetic field around the conductor.
That field strength depends on the magnitude of the current, and follows any changes in current.

Inductance is the ability of a coil to stop an electrical current from flowing through it.
An inductor coil can stop one current so a different one is able to flow.

# What is an Inductor?
If a time varying current flowing through a coil there is an [electromotive force (EMF)][03] induced in it.
The induced EMF across the coil is directly proportional to the rate of change of current with respect to time.
Due to the property inducing EMF, all types of electrical coil can be referred as inductor.
An inductor is an energy storage device which stores energy in form of magnetic field.

# Inductor Parasitic Properties
In electrical circuits, a [parasitic element][05] is a circuit element
(resistance, inductance or capacitance)
that is possessed by the electrical component but which it is not desirable for it to have for its intended purpose.
Parasitic elements are unavoidable,
Component designers will strive to minimise parasitic elements, but they are unable to completely eliminate them.

The main and most dominant parameter of a resistor, capacitor or coil can be easily determinated by a single measurement. However, if one needs a complete picture of the main and parasitic properties, then a single measurement is not sufficient.

# Measurement
Inductance is usually measured in units called millihenrys or microhenrys. It is commonly measured by using a frequency generator and an oscilloscope or an LCM multimeter. It can also be calculated through a voltage-current slope measuring the change in the electrical current passing through the coil.
