What the hell is going on?

In 1960, [Eugene Wigner][01]
published a now classic article on the philosophy of mathematics and of physics,
"[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences][02]"
(reprint of the original article [here][03])

[How math and science move in opposite directions](https://medium.com/@jblake17/how-math-and-science-move-in-opposite-directions-53820a836c4c)

# Philosophy
It may be wise to learn a little more about philosophy to truly appreciate and master the topics below.
Philosophy is the systematic and critical study of fundamental questions that arise
about existence, logic, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.
The philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.

So [what is Philosophy][04], [why do you need to know about it][05], [is it at all useful][06],
and  after all, [isn't it dead][07]?

# Impulse
A function is a relation that uniquely associates members of one set with members of another set. More formally, a function from A to B is an object f such that every a in A is uniquely associated with an object f(a) in B. A function is therefore a many-to-one (or sometimes one-to-one) relation.

 A distribution is sometimes also called a "generalized function" or "ideal function." As its name implies, a generalized function is a generalization of the concept of a function. For example, in physics, a baseball being hit by a bat encounters a force from the bat, as a function of time. Since the transfer of momentum from the bat is modeled as taking place at an instant, the force is not actually a function. Instead, it is a multiple of the delta function.
