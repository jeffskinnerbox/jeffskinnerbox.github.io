What the hell is going on?

In 1960, [Eugene Wigner][01]
published a now classic article on the philosophy of mathematics and of physics,
"[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences][02]"
(reprint of the original article [here][03])

# Philosophy
It may be wise to learn a little more about philosophy to truly appreciate and master the topics below.
Philosophy is the systematic and critical study of fundamental questions that arise
about existence, logic, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.
The philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.

So [what is Philosophy][04], [why do you need to know about it][05], [is it at all useful][06],
and  after all, [isn't it dead][07]?

# Impulse
A function is a relation that uniquely associates members of one set with members of another set. More formally, a function from A to B is an object f such that every a in A is uniquely associated with an object f(a) in B. A function is therefore a many-to-one (or sometimes one-to-one) relation.

 A distribution is sometimes also called a "generalized function" or "ideal function." As its name implies, a generalized function is a generalization of the concept of a function. For example, in physics, a baseball being hit by a bat encounters a force from the bat, as a function of time. Since the transfer of momentum from the bat is modeled as taking place at an instant, the force is not actually a function. Instead, it is a multiple of the delta function.

## The Speed of Light
Maxwell's equations say the velocity of electromatic waves is inversely proportional
the permittivity and permeability of free space.
It makes sense that the velocity of any wave would be inversely proportional to the resistance of the substance it is traveling in.
You might ask, why does resistance take on the values they do?
No one knows why. These are just the constants of nature.

About 40 years after Maxwell, Einstein did his own thought experiments inspired by Maxwell’s equation.
His thought experiment was based on one simple assumption.
He asked if the speed of light is an inherent property of space,
why would this speed be any different based on the speed of the observer?
And it was from this simple assumption,
that he came up with the special theory of relativity in 1905 which changed our ideas about the nature of time.

# Bayesian Statistics
Bayesian statistics is a theory in the field of statistics based on the Bayesian interpretation of probability where probability expresses a degree of belief in an event. The degree of belief may be based on prior knowledge about the event, such as the results of previous experiments, or on personal beliefs about the event. This differs from a number of other interpretations of probability, such as the frequentist interpretation that views probability as the limit of the relative frequency of an event after many trials.
