# What is the Importance of Prime Numbers?

# What is the Riemann Hypothesis?
The Riemann Hypothesis is one of the [Millennium Prize Problems](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/millennium-prize-problems).

The first computations of zeros of the zeta function were performed by
Riemann and where done by hand.
[Alan Turing and the Riemann Zeta Function](http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/turing.zeta.pdf)

The Riemann Hypothesis asserts that all the 'non-obvious' zeros
of the zeta function are complex numbers with real part 1/2.

Riemann hypothesis, formulated in 1859, also appears in the list of
twenty-three problems discussed in the address given in Paris by David Hilbert on August 9, 1900.

The prime number theorem determines the average distribution of the primes.
The Riemann hypothesis tells us about the deviation from the average.

[Euler’s Pi Prime Product and Riemann’s Zeta Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFwSIdLSosI)

The Riemann hypothesis isn't the only
historical questions regarding prime numbers are still unsolved.
These include

* Goldbach's conjecture, that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes
* twin prime conjecture, that there are infinitely many pairs of primes having just one even number between them.

[The Prime Pages: prime number research, records, and resources](http://primes.utm.edu/)

A prime number is a positive whole number greater than one which is divisible only by itself and one.

2 is the only even prime – all other even numbers are divisible by 2

1 is neither prime nor composite by convention - http://primes.utm.edu/notes/faq/one.html

## Fundamental theorem of Arithmetic
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic (FTA),
also called the unique factorization theorem or the unique-prime-factorization theorem
states that every integer greater than  either is prime itself
or is the product of a unique combination of prime numbers.

Prime Number Theorm, sometimes called the Dirichlet prime number theorem,
states that for any two positive coprime integers a and d, there are
infinitely many primes of the form a + nd, where n is a non-negative integer.

**prime number** (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.
**composite number** is a natural number greater than 1 that is not prime.
**unit** is the class of numbers givine to 1. These are the numbers which have a multiplicative inverse.
**analytic function** is a function that is locally given by a convergent power series. There exist both real analytic functions and complex analytic functions, categories that are similar in some ways, but different in others. Functions of each type are infinitely differentiable, but complex analytic functions exhibit properties that do not hold generally for real analytic functions. A function is analytic if and only if its Taylor series about x0 converges to the function in some neighborhood for every x0 in its domain.
**Mathematical analysis** is the branch of mathematics dealing with limits and related theories, such as differentiation, integration, measure, infinite series, and analytic functions
**analytic number theory** is a branch of number theory that uses methods from mathematical analysis to solve problems about the integers.
