# MIT RACECAR
[RACECAR/J][01] is derived from the open source [MIT RACECAR][02],
an “open-source powerful platform for robotics research and education”.
The RACECAR/J Chassis is based on the [TRAXXAS Slash 4×4 Platinum Truck][03],
an upgraded version of the normal Slash 4×4 which adds aluminum bits
and pieces such as C-hubs, steering blocks, rear hub carriers and axle nuts.

# 3D Printed RC Car
The term "R/C" has been used to mean both "remote controlled" and "radio controlled", where "remote controlled" includes vehicles that are connected to their controller by a wire, but common use of "R/C" today usually refers to vehicles controlled by a radio-frequency link.

The world of [RC has many choices][04],
but you could lump all RC’ers into one of two groups: those who race and those who don’t.

* **Racer -**
* **Basher -** Bashing is racing without rules or regulations. It is just driving and testing the limits of your RC car or truck. Bashing includes making high jumps and not worrying too much about the landing. Wrecks are not something to be avoided but rather something to laugh about.

# Radio Controller
The [DumboRC X6 2.4G 6CH Transmitter with X6FG Receiver][05]
an affordable easy to use Transmitter for cars.
The X6FG is a 6 channel receiver (voltage range: 4.8-12v, support 1S-3S batteries)
can handle just about any model setup with extra auxiliary accessories.
Receiver response time is 3 milli-seconds and a range of distances from 400-500 meters.
To top it off, the X6FG receiver has a built in Gyro for applications where steering stabilisation is needed.
It also has a throttle speed limit adjustment function, allowing beginners to practice at a safe speed.
