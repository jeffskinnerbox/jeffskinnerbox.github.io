# MIT RACECAR
[RACECAR/J][01] is derived from the open source [MIT RACECAR][02],
an “open-source powerful platform for robotics research and education”.
The RACECAR/J Chassis is based on the [TRAXXAS Slash 4×4 Platinum Truck][03],
an upgraded version of the normal Slash 4×4 which adds aluminum bits
and pieces such as C-hubs, steering blocks, rear hub carriers and axle nuts.
