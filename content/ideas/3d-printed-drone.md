Drones are defined as "an unmanned aircraft or ship guided by remote control or onboard computers",
and have been around for over [100 hundred years][01].
These remote-controlled flying crafts have become an increasingly popular project to work on,
including building and racing them.
[FPV Drone Racing][02] has become a popular sport and it even has its own league.
The Drone Racing League was created in 2015 and features racing with custom-built drones that traveling over 100 MPH.
