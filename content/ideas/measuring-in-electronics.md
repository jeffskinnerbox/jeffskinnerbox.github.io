# Mili-Ohm Measurement
Measuring low resistances with a standard multimeter is difficult and very inaccurate.

## Kelvin Probes
Kelvin probes are a special type of probe for making accurate resistance measurements using four wires and, in fact, the probe’s jaws are electrically isolated from each other.

 Why is this better than two probes? It all comes down to resistance in the test probes. Pulling supply current through the probe wires — which have some resistance — causes a voltage drop that affects the measurement. While the sense wire pair will also have resistance, the sensing current can be very small which means there will be correspondingly less error in the measurement.

# Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)
Vector Network Analyzers are used to test component specifications
and verify design simulations to make sure systems and their components work properly together.

# Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR)
A time-domain reflectometer (TDR) is an electronic instrument used to determine the characteristics of electrical lines by observing reflected waveforms.
It can be used to characterize and locate faults in metallic cables  It can also be used to locate discontinuities in a connector, printed circuit board, or any other electrical path.
