**Computational Electromagnetics (CEM)**
is the process of modeling the interaction of electromagnetic fields with physical objects and the environment.
It typically involves using computationally efficient approximations to Maxwell's equations and is used to calculate antenna performance, electromagnetic compatibility, radar cross section and electromagnetic wave propagation.

**Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD)**
is a numerical analysis technique used for modeling computational electrodynamics (finding approximate solutions to the associated system of differential equations). Since it is a time-domain method, FDTD solutions can cover a wide frequency range with a single simulation run, and treat nonlinear material properties in a natural way.

# Antenna Radiation Pattern
In the field of antenna design the term radiation pattern
(or antenna pattern or far-field pattern)
refers to the directional (angular) dependence of the strength of the radio waves from the antenna. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pattern
